Keybind Training
================

This jQuery javascript application is designed to allow a user to capture and customize key presses that will be replayed back to the users in a random order. The goal of the user is to press the corresponding key displayed to them as quickly and accurately as possible. The user is measured in accuracy and key presses per minute.

Features & Operation
====================

Automatic capturing of keys by pressing the "Capture Key Presses" button allows for easy, quick entry of keys the users wishes to practice. Keys will remain in order as they are entered.

Configuration includes custom key names, and color. Clicking the "key name" presents an edit field. Clicking the color box presents a pallette to choose from. When benchmarking, the name will be presented in the center of the screen, and the background will change to the corresponding color of the key presented. Configuration is stored as JSON in the Config Panel in the lower left corner. This allows the user to save the configuration to use later, or share with others. Pasting configs in this text box and clicking "Import Config" will load said configuration.

Clicking "Start Benchmark" will present a 3 second countdown timer until the benchmark begins. Clicking the button again will stop the benchmark. Accuracy and key presses per minute are presented on the right hand panel in realtime during a benchmark, but also stored in the Benchmark History text area in the bottom right corner, allowing the user to easily export the data for reporting and analysis. The Minutes field at the top specifies the fixed amount of time the benchmark will run for - when the time runs out, the benchmark will stop and the results are stored in the Benchmark History text box.

Why
===

Getting use to awkward gaming keyboards can be frustrating. This application allows a user to configure keybindings which represent the keys they wish to practise at a high and constant rate as a form of practice, but also to build muscle memory.
